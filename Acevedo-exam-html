		<h2>WELCOME</h2>

		<p>I'm a grumpy, fluffy cat that wants to rule the world. I like treaties. I have a golden retriever named Boots who is my #1 Minion. Suck it. Hollywood</p>

		<h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
		<p>I'm a Cat. I have the unfortunate ability to poop in my fur. Sometimes when I'm scared I open my eyes really wide and then fall asleep. I like to go on walks with my leash, but when that gets hard I sit down. I like my friend Boots, a stupid golden retriever who never know when I'm sneaking up. My favorite thing to do is eat. When I'm not eating, I feel like I forgot to eat so I go  back to eat again. I'm really good at staring, and if I stare too long I forget what I'm doing and fall asleep. I'm really fluffy so I cough up a lot of hair balls. That scares me, so much so, that I will meow until someone comes and holds me. I'm the apartment police. So if you are going to the bathroom I might scratch and meow at the door to say, "who's in there? open up!" I like my butt scratched.</p>

		<h2>BIOGRAPHY</h2>
		<p>I was abandoned on the side of the road and rescued by the Himalayan and Persian Society. I went to the doctor and was cleared for adoption through Petco where I met my Master, Anne Marie Avey. She cuddles me and feeds me and even sings to me which makes me happy. So happy I fall asleep.</p>
		

		<h2>AWARDS</h2>

		<p>I've been recognized by the presitigious column, The Daily What, which shared what I already knew...how great I am. Yes, editor Kristen Martine took one look at me and could not resist. The rest is history. The Minion Mutiny continues.</p>

		<h3>MY NEMESIS GRUMPY CAT</h3>
